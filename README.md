# SMART-PLANT-MONITORING
 IoT-based Smart Plant Monitoring with Intruder Detection using Arduino UNO , ESP8266, Blynk, and Python

This project combines IoT-based plant monitoring with a basic home security feature using facial
recognition. It ensures your plant receives the right conditions for growth while also detecting intruders
using face detection. The system uses ESP8266 for sensor control and data logging, Blynk IoT Cloud for live
monitoring, and Python + OpenCV for webcam-based intruder alert.

Features :
1)Real-time soil moisture, temperature, and humidity monitoring.
2)Automatic watering via relay when soil is dry.
3)Local LED indicators to reflect soil status.
4)Live data dashboard using Blynk Cloud.
5)Intruder detection via laptop webcam using OpenCV.
6)Instant buzzer alert and notification via Blynk if face is detected.
7)Live camera streaming via a Flask web app.

Future Improvements :
1)Add image capture and logging for intruder faces
2)Use ESP32-CAM to eliminate need for PC webcam
3)Add water level monitoring
4)Enable notifications via email/WhatsApp
